[Frontend: Next.js Pages/Routes (UX-First Wizards)]
  - /dataroom: Secure sharing (no account needed, permissions via Link model)
  - /lp/onboard: Account creation (extend NextAuth for LP role)
  - /lp/dashboard: Personalized fundroom (cards for commitments/docs, bank connect via Plaid wizard)
  - /admin/fund/[id]: GP dashboards (aggregates, cap tables, bulk actions)
  - Components: shadcn/ui modals/wizards (e.g., NDA e-sign drag-drop, subscription push)
  - Styling: Tailwind (mobile-responsive, high-contrast CTAs)

[Backend: Next.js API Routes & Middleware]
  - Auth: NextAuth (roles: 'LP'/'GP', session-based gating)
  - API: /api/subscriptions/create (upload/push docs with amount), /api/transactions (Plaid in/out), /api/k1/generate (Wolters Kluwer hook)
  - Webhooks: middleware.ts (e.g., Plaid events update Prisma, Resend notifications)
  - Logic: Entity mode ('FUND'/'STARTUP') gates features (e.g., units vs. shares)

[Data Layer: Prisma/PostgreSQL]
  - Models: Entity (fund/startup mode, configs like thresholds/fees/pricing tiers), Investor (fundId, signedDocs), Subscription (amount, status), Transaction (in/out, audits), FundAggregate (totals, AUM), Share (for startups: pricePerShare, vesting)
  - Relations: Multi-fund (Entity 1:M Investor/Subscription), audits (JSON with IP/timestamps)
  - Analytics: Tinybird (queries for AUM/fees, configure TINYBIRD_TOKEN)

[Integrations & Storage (Internal-First)]
  - Payments: Plaid (bank connect/transfers), Stripe hybrid (payouts)
  - Compliance: Persona (KYC post-bank), self-hosted e-sign (custom React/pdf-lib)
  - Emails: Resend (notifications, e.g., call notices)
  - Storage: Blob (S3/Vercel/Replit Object Storage for docs/certs), export/import (/api/export JSON/CSV/ZIP for migrations)
  - External Hooks: Wolters Kluwer (K1 gen), QuickBooks (expenses, Phase 3)

[Deployment & Testing]
  - Proto: Replit (Agent prompts for builds, npm run dev)
  - Prod: Vercel (preview branches, .github/workflows CI/CD)
  - Testing: Jest E2E (flows like dataroom → sign → commit track)
  - Security: Audit logs (Prisma Visit extend), role middleware
