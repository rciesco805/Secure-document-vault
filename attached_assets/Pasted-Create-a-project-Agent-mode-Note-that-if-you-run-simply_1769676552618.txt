Create a project
Agent mode: Note that if you run simply tb, the CLI will run in "agent mode", enabling you to work purely with natural language commands. Read more about Tinybird code.

Start with the project structure tb create:

./datasources       → Where your data lives. Define the schema and settings for your tables.
./endpoints         → Expose real-time HTTP APIs of your transformed data.
./materializations  → Stream continuous updates of the result of a pipe into a new data source.
./copies            → Capture the result of a pipe at a moment in time and write it into a target data source.
./sinks             → Export your data to external systems on a scheduled or on-demand basis.
./pipes             → Transform your data and reuse the logic in endpoints, materializations and copies.
./fixtures          → Files with sample data for your project.
./tests             → Test your pipe files with data validation tests.
./connections       → Connect to and ingest data from popular sources: Kafka, S3 or GCS.

First things first, you need a data source. Use NYC yellow taxis dataset if you don't have sample data.

tb datasource create --url https://tbrd.co/taxi_data.parquet --name trips

This creates a new file in your project:

Data sources are the definition of the database tables where you will store the data. More information about data sources
