Recommended Money Transfer APIs for Large, Infrequent Transfers
The 506(c) fund portal, where transfers involve high-value capital calls (inbound) and distributions (outbound) that aren't frequent but need to be secure, compliant, and user-friendly, I recommend APIs that specialize in ACH (Automated Clearing House) for cost-effectiveness and scale. ACH is ideal for large domestic U.S. transfers (up to $1M+ per transaction in many cases), with low fees (often 0.5-1% or flat) compared to wires, and settlement in 1-3 business days (or same-day for premium options). Wires can be added for urgency, but ACH fits your "not often" pattern while keeping costs down.
Key considerations from your principles:
	•	UX-First: Prioritize APIs with easy bank connect (e.g., one-click Plaid Link-style interfaces) via wizards in the LP dashboard.
	•	Ease/Simple Steps: Linear flow: LP connects bank once → GP pushes distributions/calls → Auto-track in Prisma.
	•	Build on Existing: Leverage your Stripe integration; extend with Treasury for ACH/wire.
	•	506(c) Compliance: APIs with built-in KYC/AML hooks (e.g., sanctions screening), audit logs (integrate with Prisma for IP/timestamps), and FDIC-insured options.
	•	Tech Stack Reuse: API calls via Next.js routes; store in new Prisma models (e.g., Transaction); display in /lp/dashboard with shadcn/ui cards/charts (Recharts for visuals).
	•	Tracking/Storage: Store per-LP (e.g., transaction history) and fund-wide (e.g., aggregates for raise progress); use Tinybird for analytics.
Start with Plaid as your primary API—it's optimized for "super easy bank connect" (their Link UI is industry-leading for minimal clicks) and handles large ACH transfers bidirectionally without needing full banking infrastructure. Integrate it with your existing Stripe for payouts if you want hybrid (e.g., Plaid for connect, Stripe for processing). This keeps things internal while adding hooks post-NDA. Avoid overkill like Sila or Tipalti (from searches) unless you need international—stick to U.S.-focused for 506(c).
Implementation Roadmap for Payments In/Out
Focus on Phase 2 (Medium-Term: Automations) from your roadmap. Add this after e-sign/subscription flows. Total effort: 1-2 weeks in Replit, testing with sandbox accounts.
1. API Setup
	•	Choose & Configure: Add Plaid/Stripe Treasury to package.json (e.g., @plaid/client). Store keys in .env (PLAID_CLIENT_ID, etc.). Use sandbox for prototyping.
	•	Bank Connect Wizard: New route /lp/bank-connect (post-NDA gate). UX: Modal wizard (shadcn/ui):
	◦	Step 1: "Connect Your Bank" button → Embed Plaid Link (React component).
	◦	Step 2: Select account → Auto-verify (Plaid Auth).
	◦	Step 3: Confirm → Store token in Prisma (new BankLink model: id, investorId, plaidToken, accountId, status).
	•	Inbound (Capital Calls): GP triggers via admin dashboard → API call to pull funds (e.g., Plaid Transfer for debit). Linear flow: Dashboard notice → LP confirms → Transfer.
	•	Outbound (Distributions): GP bulk-push button → Loop over LPs' connected banks; API batch transfer (e.g., Dwolla mass payouts if using it). One-click for all.
2. Tracking & Storage in Prisma
Extend schema (prisma/schema.prisma):
	•	New Transaction model: id, investorId (foreign key to Investor), amount (decimal), type (enum: 'inbound', 'outbound'), status (enum: 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'), method (enum: 'ach', 'wire'), date (datetime), externalId (from API), audit (JSON: IP, timestamp, userAgent).
	•	New FundAggregate model: id, totalInbound, totalOutbound, currentBalance (JSON for breakdowns).
	•	Relations: Link to Subscription/CapCall models for context.
API Routes:
	•	POST /api/transactions/create: Create transfer (e.g., Stripe API call); log to Prisma.
	•	GET /api/transactions/[investorId]: Fetch history for LP.
	•	Webhooks: Listen for API events (e.g., Plaid webhooks in middleware.ts) → Update Prisma, Resend email notifications.
3. Display in Dashboards
	•	Per-LP (/lp/dashboard): Add sections (shadcn cards):
	◦	"Your Transactions": Table of in/out history (amount, date, status).
	◦	"Balance & Calls": Progress bar for personal commitments vs. funded; list cap calls.
	◦	UX: Real-time via webhooks; big "Connect Bank" CTA if not linked.
	•	Fund General (GP Admin View): Aggregate queries (Prisma aggregate/sum on Transaction).
	◦	Cards: Total raised (inbound), Distributed (outbound), Charts (Recharts line for timeline).
	◦	Bulk actions: "Issue Distributions" button → Wizard for amount/allocation.
4. Compliance & Testing
	•	Embed post-NDA: Tie to accreditation self-ack; add KYC hook (Persona API call after connect).
	•	Audit: Auto-log all transfers in Prisma (extend Visit model).
	•	Testing: Jest E2E for flows (e.g., simulate connect → transfer). Deploy to Vercel preview; use API sandboxes to avoid real funds.
This ties into your subscription wizard: Post-sign → Bank connect → Pay commitment. 
Best Choice: Plaid
Based on current market options (verified via searches and site details), here's a comparison of top APIs, and prioritized those handling bidirectional flows, mass distributions, and large limits, with seamless integration for investment funds. We will use Plaid.
