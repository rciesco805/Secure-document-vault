In the Secure-document-vault repo (forked from Papermark, with Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Stripe, Plaid, Persona, Resend, Tinybird), perform a complete and full platform test to identify all bugs. Focus on UX-first principles: mobile-responsive, minimal clicks, linear flows (dataroom → "Sign Me Up" → onboard → NDA/accreditation gate → dashboard unlock → subscriptions/transfers). Build on existing: Use Jest for E2E (extend if needed), add Cypress for browser tests if absent (install via package.json). Test all Phase 1-3 features, compliance (506(c) audit logs/IP/timestamps, role isolation for LP/GP), automations (webhooks, emails), and data portability (/api/export). Run in dev mode (npm run dev), use sandboxes for APIs (e.g., Plaid/Stripe test keys, Persona sandbox). Output a detailed bug report (markdown table: Bug ID, Description, Severity (Low/Med/High), Steps to Reproduce, Suggested Fix). Cover these areas:

Setup & Environment Check: Verify tech stack (Next.js routes, Prisma models like Entity/Investor/Subscription/Transaction/BankLink/Share/Signature, middleware for auth/gating). Migrate Prisma (npx prisma migrate dev), seed test data (e.g., mock fund with $1.8M threshold, LP users, docs). Check .env vars (e.g., PLAID_CLIENT_ID, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, PERSONA_API_KEY, TINYBIRD_TOKEN). Test mobile responsiveness (emulate via browser tools).
Phase 1 Core Flows (LP Account & Fundroom): E2E test dataroom → Sign Me Up button (visibility/redirect to /lp/onboard) → account creation (form validation, Prisma Investor create, auto-login) → NDA gate modal (2-step wizard: e-sign NDA via custom drag-drop, accreditation self-ack checkbox; store IP/timestamp) → dashboard unlock (cards for data/docs, unique per LP via session). Bugs: Check for broken redirects, unsigned NDA bypass, mobile modal overlap.
Phase 2 Automations & Integrations: Test subscription wizard (/lp/dashboard: review → e-sign → Stripe/Plaid pay → confirm; update Subscription/Transaction models, Resend email). KYC post-bank (Persona embed after connect, store KycResult). Bank connect (/lp/bank-connect: Plaid Link modal, store token in BankLink). Transfers (inbound calls: GP trigger → LP confirm → ACH pull; outbound distributions: bulk push). Reporting (Recharts charts, K1 stubs via Wolters Kluwer hook, Tinybird analytics). Bugs: API failures (e.g., webhook misses), real-time updates, fee calculations (2.5% AUM, tiered units).
Phase 3 Scaling & Expansions: Test multi-entity (toggle FUND/STARTUP modes: units/tiers vs. shares/vesting/price per share). Cap table (/admin/cap-table: Prisma Share, Recharts %). Bulk calls/distributions (GP actions). Audit dashboard (exports, extend Visit for logs). PWA/mobile polish (push notifications). QuickBooks/Wolters Kluwer integrations (hooks). Data export (/api/export: JSON/CSV/ZIP all models). Bugs: Role middleware (LP sees only own data), mode switches, export completeness.
General Bug Scans: Security (auth bypass, data leaks via middleware). Performance (load times for dashboards/charts). Edge cases (expired sessions, invalid inputs, network errors). Compliance (accreditation/KYC gates, audit JSON completeness). UI/UX (Tailwind responsiveness, shadcn modals/wizards, CTAs visibility). Integrations (webhooks for Plaid/Stripe/Persona/Resend; error handling). Multi-fund flexibility (1:M relations for Investor/Subscription).

Run all tests (npm test or equivalent), simulate users (e.g., GP/LP roles via NextAuth). If bugs found, attempt auto-fixes for simple ones (e.g., add validations) and commit. Final output: Comprehensive bug report + test coverage summary (aim 80%+). UX: Ensure tests mimic real users (minimal steps, clear errors). Commit changes.
