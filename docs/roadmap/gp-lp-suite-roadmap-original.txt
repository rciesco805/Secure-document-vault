We're enhancing it into a full 506(c) fund LP portal for GPs managing private investments—focusing on tech-driven capital raises, transactions, and reporting. Key emphasis: User experience (UX) as #1 priority, with ease of use and simple steps guiding every feature. No complex flows; aim for intuitive, 3-5 step processes per action (e.g., from dataroom to subscription).
The new "unique fundroom" (per-LP dashboard + storage) will be a personalized, secure space for each investor post-account creation. It includes: fund data (full raise status, capital call notices), personal signed docs, notes/feedback to GP, and ties into automated capital management (e.g., Stripe payments for commitments) and reporting (e.g., custom dashboards for metrics/K-1s).
Core Principles for Build:
UX-First: Mobile-responsive (Tailwind/shadcn/ui), minimal clicks, clear CTAs (e.g., big "Sign Me Up" button). Use guided wizards for onboarding (e.g., step-by-step NDA + accreditation).
Ease/Simple Steps: Break everything into linear flows (e.g., dataroom → button → account create → NDA gate → dashboard unlock).
Build on Existing: Leverage Next.js routes, Prisma models (e.g., extend User/Team for Investor), self-hosted e-sign (custom React drag-drop), Resend emails, webhooks, and Stripe integrations. No external APIs like OpenSign—keep it internal.
506(c) Compliance: Embed accreditation self-ack, audit logs (IP/timestamps/user agent via Prisma), and hooks for KYC/AML (e.g., Persona API post-NDA).
Tech Stack Reuse: Next.js (routes/UI), TypeScript, Prisma/PostgreSQL (new models for LP data), NextAuth (enhanced for LP logins), Tinybird (analytics, configure TINYBIRD_TOKEN later), Stripe (payments), blob storage (S3/Vercel).
Testing/Deployment: Use Replit for prototyping (Agent-assisted), then Vercel for prod. Add Jest for E2E tests.
Implementation Roadmap
Phased approach: Short-term (1-2 weeks, MVP core), Medium-term (2-4 weeks, full UX polish + automations), Long-term (1-2 months, scaling/compliance). Each phase includes steps, priorities, and Replit Agent prompts (copy-paste these into Replit's Agent for automation in your workspace). Assume starting from current repo (clone/pull latest).
