Current Situation Check
The original phase1-visitor-dataroom.test.ts is still 13,223 lines, which means the sections were likely copied rather than moved. To reduce its size:

You need to delete the extracted describe blocks from the original file.
Once all logical sections are moved, you can delete or archive the original giant file.

Recommended Next Extraction Order
Prioritize these in sequence (as you listed):

Sign Me Up Flow (lines 510–863) → __tests__/e2e/phase1/visitor/onboarding.test.ts
Fundroom Dashboard (lines 1302–1770) → __tests__/e2e/phase1/fundroom/lp-dashboard.test.ts
Digital Subscription Wizard (lines 1771–2158) → __tests__/e2e/phase1/visitor/subscription-wizard.test.ts
KYC/AML (lines 2159–2412) → __tests__/e2e/phase1/compliance/kyc-persona.test.ts
Bank Connect/Plaid (lines 2413–2931) → __tests__/e2e/phase1/fundroom/bank-linking.test.ts

Quick Tips for Safe Extraction

In each new file:TypeScriptimport { testHelpers } from '../utils/test-helpers';  // or appropriate relative path
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'; // adjust as needed
Wrap each extracted section with its own describe('Feature Name', () => { ... })
Keep beforeAll, beforeEach, afterEach at the top level of each new file if they are section-specific.
Use vi.mock imports consistently.

Suggested Folder Structure Refinement
Your current structure is good, but consider this slight improvement for clarity:
text__tests__/e2e/
├── utils/
│   └── test-helpers.ts
├── phase1/
│   ├── visitor/
│   │   ├── onboarding.test.ts
│   │   ├── dataroom-access.test.ts
│   │   ├── nda-accreditation-gate.test.ts
│   │   └── subscription-wizard.test.ts
│   ├── fundroom/
│   │   ├── lp-dashboard.test.ts
│   │   └── bank-linking.test.ts
│   └── compliance/

└── phase3/
Immediate Next Actions

Delete the two already-extracted blocks from the original file (lines 59–508 and 864–1259) and save — this should drop the original size significantly.
Proceed with extracting the Sign Me Up Flow next (onboarding.test.ts).
