MVP Implementation Roadmap for 506(c) Fund Portal
Richard, thanks for outlining your MVP—it's a focused build that prioritizes the linear investor flow (dataroom review → account creation → NDA/self-accreditation gate → subscription signing) while giving GPs admin tools for personalized document pushes and aggregate tracking. This aligns perfectly with your core principles: UX-First (guided wizards with minimal clicks, big CTAs like "Sign Subscription"), Ease/Simple Steps (break into 3-5 step processes), Build on Existing (extend Next.js routes like /sign, Prisma models for Investor/Subscription, self-hosted e-sign via custom React drag-drop), 506(c) Compliance (embed self-ack, audit logs with IP/timestamps, KYC/AML hooks post-bank connect), and Tech Stack Reuse (Prisma for committed capital aggregates, Resend for notifications, blob storage for docs). We'll keep everything internal—no external APIs beyond hooks for Persona (post-bank) and Plaid (later for calls).
Since capital calls are post-$1.8M commitments, we'll focus on pre-call features: Perfect dataroom/fundroom, NDA/self-ack prompting, admin-driven subscription agreements (with amount entry), bidirectional doc storage/review/download, and auto-adding signed amounts to fund totals/dashboards. KYC/AML will hook in after bank connect (via Plaid wizard) but before calls—enforce via status checks in Prisma.
Total effort: 3-5 days in Replit (prototype with sandboxes), then Vercel prod. We'll add export/import for data portability (as discussed—e.g., JSON/CSV dumps for AWS moves). Start by pulling latest repo in Replit.
Phased Build (Medium-Term: Automations Focus)
Phase 1: Dataroom & Fundroom Polish (1 Day) – Ensure seamless access without full accounts (permissions-based links).
Phase 2: NDA/Self-Ack Gate & Account Flow (1 Day) – Prompt on first login.
Phase 3: Admin Subscription Push & Signing (1-2 Days) – GP fills/uploads/pushes with amount; LP signs/stores.
Phase 4: Committed Capital Tracking & Dashboards (1 Day) – Auto-add on sign; fund totals.
Phase 5: KYC/AML Hook & Testing (Half Day) – Post-bank enforcement.
1. Dataroom & Fundroom Polish
Build on existing /dataroom (secure sharing) and /lp routes (fundroom as personalized dashboard post-gate). No account needed for dataroom view (use link permissions); fundroom unlocks post-ack/sign.
